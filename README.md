# sandbox
a place to experiment and dev little stand-alone features

Projects list:

1. computeThickness -> compute stl models thickness in each vertex, measured along its normal
	\n status 	: not working
	\n roadmap	: make it working, color vertices based on local thickness
2. debugModule -> try debugjs lib
	\n status  : ok
	\n roadmap : none
3. linkMeshes -> generate a geometry to link two profiles
	\n status	: working
	\n roadmap : find best starting vertex. Improve performance. Make GUI.
4. logs -> try logger libs (last is scribejs)
	\n status	: in dev
	\n roadmap	: make an easily and quick integration. Create log reader.
5. orderPoints -> algorithm(s) to order points along a path
	\n status	: working
	\n roadmap : none
6. pyt -> python self-training
	\n status	: elementary
	\n roadmap	: try numpy
7. sendMsgSlack -> send msg on slack programmatically
	\n status	: working
	\n roadmap : try insert pictures or files
8. stretchIt -> stretch meshes in various ways
	\n status	: working
	\n roadmap : try with stl meshes. Implement 0-tan in connection points
9. watchAndClean -> script to watch a folder and clean it when too big
	\n status	: working (not very well)
	\n roadmap	: improve
10. xray -> playing with shaders in order to obtain an xray-like rendering
	\n status	: working
	\n roadmap	: pass from beautiful render to somehow useful render
11. crop -> based on AMIjs, crop image through shader
	\n status  : working
	\n roadmap : pass array of points & normals to manage various frustum shapes. Manage multiple crops.
