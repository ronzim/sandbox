# sandbox
a place to experiment and dev little stand-alone features

Projects list:

1. computeThickness -> compute stl models thickness in each vertex, measured along its normal
	status 	: not working
	roadmap	: make it working, color vertices based on local thickness
2. debugModule -> try debugjs lib
	status  : ok
	roadmap : none
3. linkMeshes -> generate a geometry to link two profiles
	status	: working
	roadmap : find best starting vertex. Improve performance. Make GUI.
4. logs -> try logger libs (last is scribejs)
	status	: in dev
	roadmap	: make an easily and quick integration. Create log reader. 
5. orderPoints -> algorithm(s) to order points along a path 
	status	: working
	roadmap : none
6. pyt -> python self-training
	status	: elementary
	roadmap	: try numpy
7. sendMsgSlack -> send msg on slack programmatically
	status	: working
	roadmap : try insert pictures or files
8. stretchIt -> stretch meshes in various ways
	status	: working 
	roadmap : try with stl meshes. Implement 0-tan in connection points 
9. watchAndClean -> script to watch a folder and clean it when too big
	status	: working (not very well)
	roadmap	: improve
10. xray -> playing with shaders in order to obtain an xray-like rendering
	status	: working
	roadmap	: pass from beautiful render to somehow useful render
